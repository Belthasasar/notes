Today Notes:

RAM:
  RAM is a primary storage.
  types:
        static RAM - it is faster than Dynamic RAM
        Dynamic RAM
    these are volatile memory.

Microprocessors:
  it is contain the processes only.

Buses:
  it is used to transfer the datas 
  Types:
      I-bus - Instruction bus
      D-bus - Data bus
      S-bus - System bus

Peripheral:
  it is used to communicate to the outside enviornment.
  it is send by using system bus

Microcontroller:
  it is contain I/O,CPU

 Bit-wise Operators:
      AND (&&)
      OR (||)  
      NOT (!)
AND(&) operator:
  zero with anything answer is zero.
  one with one the answer is one.
  It is like a multiplication.
OR(||) operator:
  one with anything answer is one.
  zero with zero the answer is zero.
  it is like a addition.
NOT(!) operator:
  it is return answer's opposite

Truth table
 A B AND OR 
(A & B) (A | B) 
0 0 0 0 
0 1 0 1 
1 0 0 1 
1 1 1 1 

GPIO - general purpose input output
  it is used for
      reading digital signal
      issuing interurupts
      generating triggers for external components

GPIO pin:
    value consist of one of two voltage settings use can program each pin 

GPIO port:
     many pins join together is called port

Multiplexing:
    pins act as GPIO,UART etc...

Input buffer:
    0 is enable to the input buffer

output buffer:
    1 is enable the output buffer.

IC state:
    you cannot predict the pin is high/low 
    this is called IC state.

    used in pull up (or) pull down register to stable the input mode
