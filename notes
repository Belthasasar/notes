daily update about the classes

NOTES

RAM:
  RAM is a primary storage.
  types:
        static RAM - it is faster than Dynamic RAM
        Dynamic RAM
    these are volatile memory.

Microprocessors:
  it is contain the processes only.

Buses:
  it is used to transfer the datas 
  Types:
      I-bus - Instruction bus
      D-bus - Data bus
      S-bus - System bus

Peripheral:
  it is used to communicate to the outside enviornment.
  it is send by using system bus

Microcontroller:
  it is contain I/O,CPU

 Bit-wise Operators:
      AND (&&)
      OR (||)  
      NOT (!)
AND(&) operator:
  zero with anything answer is zero.
  one with one the answer is one.
  It is like a multiplication.
OR(||) operator:
  one with anything answer is one.
  zero with zero the answer is zero.
  it is like a addition.
NOT(!) operator:
  it is return answer's opposite

Truth table
 A B AND OR 
(A & B) (A | B) 
0 0 0 0 
0 1 0 1 
1 0 0 1 
1 1 1 1 

GPIO - general purpose input output
  it is used for
      reading digital signal
      issuing interurupts
      generating triggers for external components

GPIO pin:
    value consist of one of two voltage settings use can program each pin 

GPIO port:
     many pins join together is called port

Multiplexing:
    pins act as GPIO,UART etc...

Input buffer:
    0 is enable to the input buffer

output buffer:
    1 is enable the output buffer.

IC state:
    you cannot predict the pin is high/low 
    this is called IC state.

    used in pull up (or) pull down register to stable the input mode

﻿GPIO -------------->Have 7 memory space and address,that memory space is called Registers


GPIOA------------>0x4002 0000  -  0x4002 03FF
 
                                                      |
                           All registers for GPIOA have been inside
 
Different address space but only one register

Registers:
     ----->MODER
      ------>OTYPER
      ------>PUPDR
      ------>IDR
      ------>ODR
      ------>BSRR
    ------>LCKR
     ------>AFRL
     ------>AFRH

==> GPIOA  base address will be ------> 0x4002 0000
==> When we know that base address of GPIOA and we know that offset 0x00 then we know the place.

A= Base address(20) + offset(2)
then the base address will be A(22)
{base address + offset}

Hexadecimal:
      decimal numbers 0 - 9
      hexadecimal represent the four bits

MODER REGISTER:
      A = base address + offset : 0x00
             start address will be A

OTYPER REGISTER:
       base address + offset : 0x04   --------->Increase by 4  [increase by 4].
                                                                                   UL ---> Unsigned Long

periphereal base|  4002 0000
                                      |
peripheral offset |         2 0000
Base              |         4000 0000

Peripheral Base (Peripheral + AHB1 PERIPH-OFFSET)


*If both address are same the offset will be zero.

[GPIOA-OFFSET =0X0000UL]

GPIOA-Base (AHB1ENR-BASE + GPIO-OFFSET)  
          

* When we use the (Volatile unsigned int *) then we call as address

* When we do the Integer pointer type cast  (RCCBase + AHB1EN_R_OFFSET) will be changed as address.

WE USE OUTSIDE “*   POINTER” IT HELPS TO FIND THE VALUES OF THE ADDRESS 
(*(volatile unsigned int *)(RCC_BASE + AHB1EN_R OFFSET))

(volatile unsigned int *)(RCC_BASE + AHB1EN_R OFFSET)-this line used to creat address

(*(volatile unsigned int *)(RCC_BASE + AHB1EN_R OFFSET))-this line used to access the address of the value.
